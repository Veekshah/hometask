            <h3>Quote to Inspire</h3>
            <p>"To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, — that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost, — and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within,
            more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought,
            because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."
